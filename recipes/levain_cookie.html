        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 410 degrees.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together cold butter and sugars until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Add cocoa, cake flour, all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt and stir until combined. Stir in peanut butter chips (or can substitute chocolate chips).</li>
            <li>Chill dough for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Separate dough into large balls and place on lightly colored cookie sheet. Lightly press on top of dough to smooth out. They are bigger than you think! You will fit 4 cookies on one large cookie sheet. The dough makes 8 extra large cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8-11 minutes or until golden brown on the top. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes to set.</li>
        </ol>
